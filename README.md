# r_giskard

Small project for experiments with emotions, unconditioned and conditioned reflexes

(Note: The project named after R.Giskard, a robot from novels by I.Asimov which could control human's emotions)

## Terms

**Emotions** are biological states associated with the nervous system brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioral responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure [Source: Emotion - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion)

**A reflex**, or reflex action, is an involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus. A reflex is made possible by neural pathways called reflex arcs which can act on an impulse before that impulse reaches the brain. The reflex is then an automatic response to a stimulus that does not receive or need conscious thought.

**Classical conditioning** occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US). Usually, the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus (e.g., the sound of a tuning fork), the unconditioned stimulus is biologically potent (e.g., the taste of food) and the unconditioned response (UR) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response (e.g., salivation). After pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response (CR) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone. (A conditioned response may occur after only one pairing.) Thus, unlike the UR, the CR is acquired through experience, and it is also less permanent than the UR.

## Emotions

For implementing a model of emotions the Emotional core was developed. [Details here](emotional_core/README.md)

## Responses

Response model is under development. [Details here](response_core/README.md)
